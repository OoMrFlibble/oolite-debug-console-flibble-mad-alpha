Alias examples:

These are as stored in the config file. Note, OoDC will need to be restarted to show tooltips for existing buttons.

The name of the alias is used to sort the buttons (and the config file). If defining a function, the function name will be shown on the button.

If a javascript comment in the alias contains tooltip:[space], the rest of the comment will be used as a tooltip.

This is a simple example with a tooltip. I've named it _1001_Refuel to keep it high up the sort order, so it will appear top left. It has a simple one line comment containing a tooltip. When pressed, the player ship will be fuelled up instantly.

_1001_Refuel := NM:
// tooltip: Fill up with  Quirium goodness.
(function Refuel() { player.ship.fuel = 7; })()

This is similar, but with a multi-line comment. Anything after tooltip:[space] to the end of the comment will be in the tooltip. When pressed, whatever the player ship is targeting will be 'exploded'.

_1002_Bang := NM:
/*

This bit if the comment is just a comment.
Anything after tooltip[colon][space] will be used as a tooltip.

tooltip: Blow up target.
Have fun!

 */
(function Bang() {
    player.ship.target.explode();
})()
