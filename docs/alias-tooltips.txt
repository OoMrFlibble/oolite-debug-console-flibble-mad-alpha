Alias tooltips:

Alias definitions can include a tooltip for if a button is allocatd. The tooltip is defined in a Javascript comment. The comment can be before, inside, or after any functions.

Both // .. and /* .. */ style comments can be used.
Not catering for nested comments.
Multi-line tooltips can be used in multi-line comments.

Only one tooltip per alias will be used.
/* */ is searched before //, so will take priority.

Case insensitive. TooLtiP: is fine.
Everything after tooltip: is tooltip string. This means that the tooltip definition must be the last thing in the comment if it is not the only thing. You can always have another comment right?

'tooltip:' may be exactly at start of comment, like:
   //tooltip:blah

or must be preceded by one or more space/tab or newline.
 This allows any comment before like:
   // yay, here's a tooltip:blah
 Which would give a tooltip string of "blah"

 It also prevents things like:
   // whoah dude, what's a stooltip: nope!
 No tooltip here!

Single line comment examples.

//tooltip: Please do not press this button.
// Did we listen to the last alias? TOOLTIP:Please do not press this button again.

Multiline comment examples.

/*tooltip:
Test tools
can be
on multiple lines
*/

The above yields this (quotes added for clarity)
"Test tools
can be
on multiple lines"

A more complex example.
 /*
  * If we must border with asterisks, then know they are
  * not seen as part of the comment delimiters, so this:-
  *tooltip: test
  * will be ingnored
  * and any asterisks in the tooltip text will not be removed.
  * tooltip: This is a tooltip
it continues on the next line
and ends at the end of the comment

*/

Will yield:
"This is a tooltip
it continues on the next line
and ends at the end of the comment"
