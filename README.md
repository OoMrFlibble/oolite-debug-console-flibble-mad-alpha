This is very close to beta.

If anyone knows what's stopping the Mac version working, please let me know. See issue #11

FWIW the simple console works on the mac as does the v2, which is why I'm so baffled that the GUI one doesn't.

The main program is OoDC.py (Oodyssey) the Oolite Debug Console

To run from source on Ubuntu etc. this might be the incantation you require.
pip install -U --user click
pip install -U --user twisted
apt install python3-tk
